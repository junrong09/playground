# Picking up Yet Another Programming Language
*A Checklist To Productivity*

Mastering new programming languages in the everchanging tech industry is the norm in today's tech environment. Yet, it can be daunting to pick up a new programming language with speed before reaching a proficient level. Often this task requires practice and drilling. 

This checklist aims to generalise features of some imperative programming language and set them out as learning objective. I do hope that these features when abstracted can help learners like myself to find ease in "translating" from one programming language to another. 

## Level 0: Syntax and basics
- [ ] Variables declaration, assignment, primative and notable types
- [ ] Math
  - Arithmetic (e.g. `+, -, *, /, %`)
  - Increment (e.g. `++, --, +=, -=`)
- [ ] Condition
  - Logical Operation (e.g.`&&, ||`)
  - Comparison Operation (e.g. `>, <=, ==, ===`) [Note: What equates to false? null? 0?]
- [ ] Conditional Statements (e.g. `if, else if, else, switch, case, goto`)
- [ ] Iterator
  - Basic (e.g. `for, while`)
  - Over list (e.g. `foreach`)
  - Over Objects (e.g. `in`)
  - Over range    
  - Other notable iterable types
- [ ] Common Data Structure
  - e.g. Arrays, List, Set, Map/Tuple, Strings
  - Initalisation [Note: dynamically/statically sizedr]
  - Basic Manipulation (e.g. length, access, add, remove, replace, exist, copy)
- [ ] Function & method
  - Declaration
  - Access modifier (e.g. public, private) & Scope
  - Return cardinality (e.g. void, one, many)
- Convention
  - Naming
  - Loop
  - Commonly enforced...
